# stck

**stck** is a statically typed stack-based concatenative programming language

- [Documentation](doc/01_GETTING_STARTED.md)
- [Reference](doc/REFERENCE.md)
- [Examples](examples/)

# Work In Progress

This language is currently being developed by only one person as just a hobby.
While I would really appreciate if people were using this language, the language is not cross platform at all yet and might be unstable or unsafe. Anything can change at any moment.

TL;DR: **Not for production use!**
