# stck

A stack-based programming language

## Roadmap / To-Do

- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [x] Type-Checker
- [x] Type Inference
- [x] Compiler into own bytecode
- [x] Virtual Machine
- [ ] **Compiler into native** (in progress)
- [ ] **Standard Library** (in progress)
- [ ] More Examples and Documentation
- [ ] Package Manager
- [ ] Bootstrapped

The compiler is currently written in TypeScript, but I plan on rewriting the compiler in itself.
This language is compiled to its own bytecode and will have a virtual machine written in Rust, but I also plan on making it compiled to native as well.
