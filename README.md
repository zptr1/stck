# stck

A stack-based programming language

## Roadmap / To-Do

- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [x] Type-Checker
- [ ] **Type Inference** (in progress)
- [ ] **Compiler into own bytecode** (in progress)
- [ ] **Virtual Machine** (in progress)
- [ ] Turing Complete
- [ ] More Examples and Documentation
- [ ] Bootstrapped
- [ ] Compiler into native

The compiler is currently written in TypeScript, but I plan on rewriting the compiler in itself.
This language is compiled to its own bytecode and will have a virtual machine written in Rust, but I also plan on making it compiled to native as well.
