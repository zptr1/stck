# stck

**stck** is a statically typed stack-based concatenative programming language

- [Reference](doc/REFERENCE.md)
- [Examples](examples/)

# Work In Progress

This language is a work in progress and is not meant for production use!

# Using

**Requirements:** `bun`, `fasm` and `gcc`

Use `stck run file.stck` to run a stck program, or `stck build file.stck` to compile it to an ELF64 executable.
stck supports Linux x86_64 only for now.
