# stck

A stack-based programming language

## Roadmap

- [x] Lexer
- [ ] **Parser** (in progress)
- [ ] **Type-Checked** (in progress)
- [ ] Compiled into own bytecode
- [ ] Turing Complete
- [ ] Bootstrapped
- [ ] Compiled into native

The compiler is currently written in TypeScript, but I plan on rewriting the compiler in itself.
This language will be compiled to its own bytecode and will have a virtual machine written in Rust, but I also plan on making it compilable to native as well.
